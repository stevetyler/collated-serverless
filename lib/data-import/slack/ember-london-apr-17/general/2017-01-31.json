        "text": "hello folks, just run across a problem whilst trying to upgrade ember to the latest version (coming from 2.3.x). I’ve got as far as 2.8.x and discovered that a view called application.js no longer applies a `className` to the first `div` in the dom…which is a problem because I really need to set 100% height on it. I see it has been discussed at length here:\n<https:\/\/github.com\/emberjs\/ember.js\/issues\/11486>\n\nbut just wondering if anyone has any other suggestions or any tips on how to handle this one? thanks in advance!",
