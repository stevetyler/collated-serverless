I run a government funded startup that's building an Edtech product to improve attainment scores in A-Level computing. I'm looking to hire asap and the product is being built from ground-up so perfect for someone who wants to get their hands dirty. DM me if you're up for a chat. \n\nWe use full stack JS, graphql, serverless and some more cool technologies ",
