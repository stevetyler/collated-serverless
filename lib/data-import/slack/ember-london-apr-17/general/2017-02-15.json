I guess the last option is pretty much being phased out these days. :slightly_smiling_face: The reason I make this distinction is that these days phone listening is starting to force the wireless headphone onto you. Maybe that's what you want anyway (the convenience is nice) but from a fidelity standpoint the thing to bear in mind is that besides material design the biggest difference in quality if the digital-to-analogue converter built into the wireless can. If you're listening to music primarily off your laptop you can buy really good d-to-a's at a good price but the headphone manufacturers are still getting a lot of extra margin from packaging up the d-to-a benefits in their products. This is no different than what the manufacturers did in the 80's and 90's with high end CD players where the quality difference was primarily that of a good quality d-to-a but in today's world the margin is even greater because the true cost of the d-to-a is so low now.",
