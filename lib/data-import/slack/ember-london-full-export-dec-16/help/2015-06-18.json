We are currently using <http:\/\/prerender.io|prerender.io> to serve static pages to Google and other bots that have limited JS support. However this is becoming very slow as our site grows with a full site snapshot recache taking 8+ hours. This is not ideal when we are trying to improve our SEO and want to test things quickly. We have been looking at using ember fastboot (we know it is not production ready). Does anybody know if it is stable enough to work with ember-cli?",
