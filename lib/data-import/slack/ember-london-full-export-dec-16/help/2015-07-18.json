        "text": "Hello all. I just updated from ember 1.12.1 to 1.13.3 and noticed a few differences in how my templates were  being rendered. As far as i can tell it seems when i try to directly render a controller passing it a hasMany association thats asynchronous. the template rendering now seems to wait until the promise is fulfilled. Previously i had been using PromiseProxyMixin on my controllers in order to handle unresolved association promise but it seems like now i dont need to. Did i miss something in the releasenotes of ember?",
