I dont store any users in the db at this point so im not sure how much worth it will be to you. Feel free to take a look at <https:\/\/github.com\/Sound-waves\/sound-wav.es> for how to handle it on the frontend. Most of the stuff is in the login controller with mixins in other controllers to only allow access for logged in users.",
