                "text": "Scanadu, a health tech startup working on devices that can scan and upload medical-grade diagnostic tests to a smartphone, has raised $35 million in Series B financing.\nThe round was led by Chinese investment firms Fosun International and Tencent Holdings Limited, with participation from China Broadband Capital and Iglobe Partners of Singapore, as well as previous\u00a0investors Relay Ventures, Redmile Group, Ame Cloud Ventures and Three Leaf Ventures. This now brings the total funding amount up to $49.7 million.\nScanadu came out of the X Prize Foundation\u2019s\u00a0Qualcomm Tricorder competition, but soon broke an Indiegogo record, raising more than $1.6 million in less than a month for the Scout, a medical device that could check for heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature.\nThe startup out of the NASA-Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California has since started shipping the more than 8,000 orders for the Scout and has created another device called Scanaflo, which is essentially a pee stick that can detect things like blood in urine, pregnancy and STD\u2019s when the information is uploaded to your smartphone.\nScanadu is working with the FDA to get full approval for these\u00a0devices and has so far been given the green light to test them out on individuals as \u201cinvestigational devices.\u201d\nThe new funding will help the startup further push these devices out in the market for testing and continue on the path to FDA approval as a hand-held medical device for commercial use.\n\u201cWe continue to build out our family of products and move down the path to regulatory clearance in the U.S. and China,\u201d Scanadu co-founder Walter De Brouwer said. \u201cScanadu\u2019s mission has always been to give eight billion people access to quality healthcare via their smartphones.\u201d\nWe went to Scanadu\u2019s headquarters not too long ago to check out what the team was up to.
