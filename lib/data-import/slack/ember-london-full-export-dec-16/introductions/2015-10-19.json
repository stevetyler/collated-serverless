I finally managed to get access to the channel (thanks to <@U03V5B7KY> ) - I'm Ricardo and my background is more on backend, data mining and search, but got into Ember because we use it in the frontend of our platform at Localistico (<http:\/\/localistico.com>) I've previously worked for Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Vodafone\/Telefonica, so happy to help if anybody needs intros or gossip about any of them. Other than that, will try to post a couple of the job openings we have in the jobs channel soon and always happy to debate about the advantages and disadvantages of Elixir vs Go vs Ruby vs anything else (like we did at the pub the other night)",
