We are 6 developers (1 frontend, 4 backend, 1 devops) and we need another frontend dev to balance the situation, the new CTO is pretty cool, with him we moved 4 months ago from a Rails monolithic app to a microservices architecture, that means you can write a service with your favourite tech (Ember, Angular - node, ruby,  go and whatnot) without worrying too much! Contact me if you want to work with us! ---end of the message--- :smile:",
