I'm looking for two full stack or frontend only JS developers with experience of MVC frameworks, preferably Ember.js. This is a role suitable for someone with 2-4 years of relevant experience, not necessarily commercial. You need to be able to hit the ground running on day 1. \n\nBased at Mornington Crescent we have a small fun team, working on digital media and IoT, in JS, C# and C++, on PC, Raspberry Pi and embedded devices. \n\nThe first project you'd be working on are the scoreboards at Lord's cricket ground - a 280 sq m Ember app! We also work for a film studio in LA, amongst others. Very high profile customers means interesting and challenging problems to solve. It's never boring. \n\nSend CVs to me at <mailto:Bryan.crotaz@silvercurve.co.uk|Bryan.crotaz@silvercurve.co.uk> or pm me here for a chat",
