Chattermill (<https:\/\/chattermill.io\/>) is a startup in the much-hyped AI space, building something like Mixpanel for customer feedback, particularly free form text. We\u2019ve used Ember and Rails from the start and love both although also intrigued by Elixir \/ Phoenix. We are now looking for our first in-house developer. You will effectively take over leading the engineering team from me and will work closely with the founders. The project is still in its infancy, so no legacy code and you get to make all the decisions. You will also work with our data scientist and will be able to learn \/ practice some cutting edge deep learning. Please ping me here or on <mailto:mikhail@chattermill.io|mikhail@chattermill.io> if you are interested",
