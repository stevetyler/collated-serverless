I'm on the hunt for permanent or contract positions from early November in central London or remote. I enjoy programming day to day in Ruby\/Rails, Javascript\/Ember and Swift and recently began dabbling with Elixir\/Phoenix too. I've worked for several startups and established businesses as a full stack developer rolling out scalable, tested products from start to finish, back to front. The kind of company I would love to hear from are customer focused, product oriented and passionate about delivering the best experience possible to their users. If you know of or are employed by such a company please get in touch via <mailto:karlfreeman@gmail.com|karlfreeman@gmail.com> or by other means.\n\nThanks!\nKarl :heart:",
