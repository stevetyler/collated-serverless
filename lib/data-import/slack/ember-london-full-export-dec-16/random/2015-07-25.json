I focus on what I am supposed to deliver and then start to build it. Either from the project specification or task list (for formal work or school related projects) or from my head (for the ad hoc hobby projects).\n\nAs soon as code starts to appear on the screen and the functionality grows it quite easy to get that same feeling of satisfaction as leveling up in WoW. As the project grows I find it hard to not think about how things could be improved. Much like the feeling I get when I play great games. It is hard not to think about them even when you are AFK. It can be everything from additional functionality, or existing functionality that could be improved (put in the \"nice to have\" column in the todo list\/specification) or refactoring ideas that you can do when you have some down time (waiting for some other unit to be finished etc).\n\nTo me it is all about mindset. If you give it time and really apply yourself you are investing in the programming project much like the way you invest in games. There is an emotional satisfaction to be had when you manage to solve tricky problems. It might not always be as immediately satisfying as playing a game, but in the end I think it is well worth the investment.",
